// Implementation of Abstract Data Type Item

//   data object: an item which is a texting meaning associated with a texting abbreviation
//   operations: create, destroy, copy, 
//               input, output, assign

//allows for input of an item from either the standard input device or a file
//pre input has been opened and readied for the input of
//    a texting abbreviation followed by newline and associated meaning with
//    spaces between words ending with a newline. For example:
//    lol
//    laugh out loud
//
//post rightHandSideItem has been filled with a texting abbreviation and its
//     associated meaning
//usage cin >> myItem;
