//Implementation of Abstract Data Type Key
//
//   data object: a key which is a texting abbreviation
//   operations: create, destroy, copy, 
//               input, output, assign
//               check if same, check if less than, 
//               convert to an integer

//    lol
//    laugh out loud

//post rightHandSideItem has been filled with a texting abbreviation and its
//     associated meaning
